## Local Docker Run

Use the root `.env` file for local Docker Compose credentials. A sample is included in `.env.example`.

Start the stack:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
```

If Docker starts but Postgres authentication fails because of an older local volume, reset the local database volume:

```powershell
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open the app at `http://localhost`.
